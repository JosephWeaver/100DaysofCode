## R1D75: Wednesday, March 14, 2018
**Progress:** Finished up grading assignments for the first quarter of the semester; also, live-coded for hours with students during one of my workshops at Academy of Art University.

## R1D74: Tuesday, March 13, 2018
**Progress:** Mostly finished up grading assignments for the first quarter of the semester; also, live-coded for three hours in front of one of my classes at Academy of Art University.

## R1D73: Monday, March 12, 2018
**Progress:** Grading more coding assignments; also, live-coded for three hours in front of one of my classes at Academy of Art University.

## R1D72: Sunday, March 11, 2018
**Progress:** Graded coding assignments for another four hours.

## R1D71: Saturday, March 10, 2018
**Progress:** Graded coding assignments for about five hours. Ugh! üò≠üòÇ Also, updated my website to remove a few links.

**Thoughts:** My brain is... hurting, lol.

## R1D70: Friday, March 9, 2018
**Progress:** Started on my novel. By coding it!

**Thoughts:** This is inspired by one of my students' projects. She was creating an Oregon Trail clone in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and I realized that I'd be much more likely to begin to write (another habit I desperately want to get into) if I attached it with a habit I already have!

**Link to work:**
Here's the repo: [https://github.com/JosephWeaver/musical-goggles](https://github.com/JosephWeaver/musical-goggles) (I chose the default GitHub suggestion as the repository name, since it doesn't really matter. lol)

## R1D69: Thursday, March 8, 2018
**Progress:** Graded a bunch of web development homework for two of my classes at Academy of Art University. That's about all the code I can stand to look at today. My brain is glazing over.

**Thoughts:** I read Ready Player One for the first time starting last night and ending this morning. It was so great I could barely put it down! Now I know I'm a nerd. lol

## R1D68: Wednesday, March 7, 2018
**Progress:** Live-coded for hours with students during one of my workshops at Academy of Art University. There were lots of CodePens, but I don't save them :P

**Thoughts:** Very light day otherwise. Very nice.

## R1D67: Tuesday, March 6, 2018
**Progress:** Live-coded for 3 hours in front of one of my classes at Academy of Art University. There were lots of CodePens, but I don't save them :P

**Thoughts:** Another 24+ hour gap in my GitHub contributions üò≠ Streak broken! Oh well.
**POSITIVE Thoughts:** Hey, I'm 2/3 of the way through 100 Days of Code! This calls for celebration! (translation: This calls for 33 more days of coding üòú)

## R1D66: Monday, March 5, 2018
**Progress:** Continued on the Accounts prototype from my project. Also, live-coded for 3 hours in front of one of my classes at Academy of Art University. There were lots of CodePens, but I don't save them :P

**Thoughts:** Also fixed a TON of spreadsheet problems, noob-proofed it, and made it so we could turn on and off certain statistics to view others in isolation. üí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèº Doing some heaaavy lifting! üíØ

## R1D65: Sunday, March 4, 2018
**Progress:** Today was a day to March Forth!... It's a very funny joke. Today I started on an Accounts prototype to go along with my GameList prototype, it's all part of the same project. It's pretty rudimentary so far; I'm working in Pug/Sass/Babel as opposed to my normal HTML/SCSS/JS stack, so that's nice to be expanding my horizons.

**Thoughts:** Transitioned back into regular coding after a few days of just working in Google Sheets... man that was exhausting! Lol, certainly not my forte. But I make some really pretty spreadsheets, no lie. I promise you. Anyway, I'm stoked to be getting things done on this project. Very, very excited to have it done. Hopefully before the end of the year I'd like to release an amalgamation of all these prototypes I'm making, as an alpha version of the site. ü§ûüèº

## R1D65: Saturday, March 3, 2018
**Progress:** Did a bunch of spreadsheet programming. Yay, I know. Yay. But sometimes it's harder than the other kinds of programming I do. And I know people appreciate it more, so I give myself a pass there. Probably did about four hours worth today. :P

**Links to work:** None for today =P

## R1D64: Friday, March 2, 2018
**Progress:** Read a ton of stuff on [exploringjs.com](exploringjs.com). Probably about 2 hours worth.

**Thoughts:** Gigabit fiber didn't work out. Lmao, Sonic trying to play with the big boys. I'm calling Comcast tomorrow, and hopefully THEIR gigabit fiber works out.

**Links to work:** None for today =P

## R1D63: Thursday, March 1, 2018
**Progress:** Brought the GameList prototype to a pretty workable state in terms of color choices, drag-n-drop, hoverability, editability, etc.

**Thoughts:** Had some internet issues. Ugh. Getting gigabit fiber tomorrow though! üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº

## R1D62: Wednesday, February 28, 2018
**Progress:** Went from 58% complete to 64% complete in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy! Also, held a two-hour coding workshop for struggling web students, at Academy of Art University. There were lots of CodePens, but I don't save them :P ... Also also, I updated my Behance link on [my personal website](http://www.joeweaver.me). Also, many more changes and updates to GameList prototype. It's starting to look pretty finished now!

**Thoughts:** I learned some things I already knew, but it was great to have a deeper level understanding of things, and Colt's way of going over complex ideas is comforting and reassuring, and this was a good backfill for the skills I already have, and an introduction to skills I don't yet have a full grasp on, so it was totally worthwhile! :) Also, learned about and signed up for [Cloud9](c9.io) and that seems like a totally great tool! Super easy to set up and get started using! What's really frustrating though, is that I also tried Amazon AWS Cloud 9... and that is a ***FAR CRY*** more complicated and annoying to set up... argh. Hate that.

## R1D61: Tuesday, February 27, 2018
**Progress:** Many changes and updates to GameList prototype. Also, live-coded for 3 hours in front of one of my classes at Academy of Art University. There were lots of CodePens, but I don't save them :P

**Thoughts:** Fixed the Sass mixin for my color blocks, fixed drag-and-drop ghost appearance, and kinda fixed the pencil/editing behavior for the game names. I gotta fix the tags appearance somehow too, and realign a loooooot of stuff, and figure out exactly which order I wat to display content in... but it's reallllly nice to finally have my `.color-bar` idea on the left finalllly working, with the drag-and-drop, the color selector, and I even added a favorites star! :D

## R1D59: Sunday, February 25, 2018
**Progress:** Many changes and updates to GameList prototype. Started on some mixins, fixed some of the errant behaviors going on with the editing, and drag-and-dropping. Probably spent about 3 hours coding. Sweet.

## R1D58: Saturday, February 24, 2018
**Progress:** I made the drag-and-drop solution Sortable work in my project, and built out more of the game list.

**Thoughts:** Finding a solution to my drag-and-drop problem was not as hard as I thought it would be. I managed to find a no-jQuery solution in [Sortable](https://rubaxa.github.io/Sortable/) which I like a lot so far. I still need to play around with the options to get some of the desired effects that I want, but otherwise I'm enjoying it.

## R1D57: Friday, February 23, 2018
**Progress:** Learned some Pug (and used it) and practiced using my Sass (not SCSS) by creating a CodePen for a certain view of a project called Mafia Realm that I've been working on for a couple years, on and off.

**Thoughts:**
I found [Learn Pug.js with Pugs](https://codepen.io/mimoduo/post/learn-pug-js-with-pugs) which is a totally fantastic resource for learning Pug.js, and [shared that on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoeWeaverDev/status/966930313065644032) as well.

- 09 üöß [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/rJOJpz)

**Thoughts:** Disabled computer opponent choice since I wasn't able to work no the AI yet, fixed the confetti! (üéâüéäüéâüéäüéâüéä), added in a Tie game option (no confetti), changed some short variable names, fixed '==' operators so they are '===', and cleaned up a bunch.

## R1D54: Tuesday, February 20, 2018
**Progress:** Live-coded for 3 hours in front of one of my classes at Academy of Art University. No links for today! (and no commits either, meaning my GitHub streak just got broken. Oh well. Plenty of time in the future to build up other streaks.)

## R1D51: Saturday, February 17, 2018
**Progress:** Tons of changes to my freecodeCamp [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/rJOJpz) project today.

- 09 üöß [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/rJOJpz)

**Thoughts:** I changed the fonts to Oswald and Lato, added a background gradient, switched up the opponent and side-selection logic so that it showed both at the same time, and when both had been selected, you can press a play button. I also threw in a cute logo, made a logo hover CSS animation, added responsive media queries to make sure the screen size is large enough to view the game, and I put a whole bushelful of polish on everything, compared to what it had been before.

**Thoughts:** I got rid of the jQuery entirely, and I'm refactoring my functions for just JavaScript.

Also, I started adopting an object-oriented style, because I really feel like everything I write is spaghetti and that NEEDS to improve. I NEED practice doing this.

- 09 üöß [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/rJOJpz)

**Thoughts:** Had to stop using both HAML and SCSS, weirdly, because they were causing problems on CodePen... they kept switching back and forth being compiled, with every Save or AutoSave! Maybe talk to `@ChrisCoyier` about this... maybe just chalk it up to chance and try again later with the SCSS.

## R1D29: Friday, January 26, 2018
**Progress:** Continued on the Advanced Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp, and finished the Inventory Update, No Repeats Please, Make a Person, and Map the Debris challenges. Update: Finished the Pairwise challenge as well! That's all of them done! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

- 45 ‚úÖ [Map the Debris](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/map-the-debris)
- 46 ‚úÖ [Pairwise](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/pairwise)

**Thoughts:** Inventory Update wasn't too bad! I had some problems with CodePen crashing due to infinite loops when I was trying to test it out, that wasn't fun. I had to restart CodePen like five times.

No Repeats Please, on the other hand, was an absolute beast to get my mind around, but once I figured it out and searched a lot for examples of how other people had done it, it came through. I also had to learn how to use the `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` comment so that freeCodeCamp's code parser would accept my ES6 function generator syntax.

Make a Person was a cakewalk. Map the Debris was similarly relatively straightforward. Pairwise was a little hard to wrap my brain around at first, but after getting the problem in my head, it wasn't too bad. For a while I was adding the values together instead of the indices though, that wasn't good :P I was pretty confused.

## R1D25: Monday, January 22, 2018
**Progress:** Continued on the Advanced Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Exact Change was a huge pain! Figuring out exactly where to use the rounding function was a problem for me. In the end I just took off the round function from everywhere I had it, and used a bunch of `console.log()` commands to find out exactly where the math was being rounded a fraction of a penny. The other major problem I had was to return "Insufficient Funds" when I had more than enough money to make change, but not of the proper denomination, i.e. I had one single dollar, and one penny, but the change required was 50 cents. Eventually I figured that one out too. This was a really good challenge. It was challenging to wrap your head around a real life problem and solve it. It was like a more fleshed out version of the Roman Numerals algorithm problem because you actually had to deal with data type coercion, deal with limitations in programming languages (i.e. that $0.01 or 1 cent, will round to $0.0999999999987 or slightly less than a cent, meaning I would have to use rounding functions just to get basic integrity in the algorithm), and figure out use cases in which I had more than enough money, but not the correct kind to give proper change. I'm feeling happy and satisfied after having completed this one. üòä

**Thoughts:** Drop it was pretty easy. Steamroller was annoying. Skipped Steamroller for a while because I didn't wanna waste time on it until I was done with the rest. Frustratinggg. First time I skipped ahead. Then I went back and did it of course, but it took a lot of searching around online and I had to learn about new array functions which I hadn't been taught yet.

**Progress:** Continued on the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I spent a looooong time on the primes one, lol. I busted out a CodePen and basically brute forced everything, but ended up writing my own (maybe efficient?) algorithm, by re-re-re-re-factoring what I had. I ended up with a few different versions of an `isPrime(x)` function, and basically just tried to make it as un-verbose as possible without shooting myself in the foot. Eventually it worked, but I stayed up about 3 hours longer than I really should have. Eek. Tomorrow will be a struggle.

**Progress:** Still working on the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Finally just finishing it up. I cleaned up sooo many things from when I had a ton of versions of files, with a bunch of `jscrap.js`, `jscrap2.js`, `...3`, `...4`, etc., with different versions of what I'd been working on, which weren't complete and/or had code which wasn't working, and I kept starting over. I swear, I must have tried like 10-15 different versions of my main AJAX query, and like 6-10 versions of my secondary one. I ended up putting everything into a couple functions, and they ended up chaining together ... I'm not sure it's the right way to do things, but it ended up working for me.

I also practiced using arrow function syntax, which ended up working out pretty well. There can now be an even shorter jQuery document ready function wrapper: `$(()=>{ `...` })`!~ And I feel like now's when my code will finally begin to look as unintelligible to normal people as some coding geniuses' code looks to me upon first glance! üòÇ w00t! ... for real though, I have such big ambitions... a year from now, I want to not only be a rockstar/ninja, I want to teach others to be rockstars and ninjas! üòä #Pray4MeFam üôèüôå

**Progress:** Still working on the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) project from freeCodeCamp. It's turning out to be quite a turd.

**Thoughts:** I'm at my wits end with this Wikipedia API haha. I still haven't found the correct combos of parameters/properties to pass to the API to give me back the data that I need... but soon! Very soon! lol üòÖ Whenever I get sick of failing with JavaScript I keep tweaking and fiddling with the SCSS, which is great in the short term, but it can eat up a lot of time as I have been playing with literally hundreds of different options for how things could look. The end result is... it looks pretty cool, but I already know how to make things look good; I should be focusing more on making them work. Yikes.

Also, I experimented with an Autocomplete option, but since I've already spent hours tweaking the way the responsive input works, it was too hard to get the results dropdown to follow the same style, and though it was certainly possible, it would have required a lot more time than I was willing to spend on it: remember, I'd already spent hours tweaking the responsivity worked, and I'd already wasted all that time on the SCSS instead of making the JavaScript work.

I also reimagined a lot of the JavaScript because that bastard just wasn't working for some reason. I stopped using `$.getJSON` in favor of `$.ajax` since that offers me the ability to specify that I want JSONP.

**Progress:** Still working on the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Geez louise this is a lot harder than I thought it'd be! I did some nice CSS/SCSS work to make it responsive and pretty at all screen sizes (well, down to max-width: 160px at least, which is far more than it'll ever need) but the JavaScript is killing me! I'm not sure if I just suck, or if Wikipedia's API is just that hard to use... which it might be... I'm having a lot of trouble with knowing which parameters to call, and when; for instance, how important is it that I have an empty callback?

And it looks like some of the parameters I want need to be run on other types of queries, and so I'm having to try to mix queries. I still haven't had success running an API request inside of a loop which is inside of another API request ... maybe that's impossible, who knows?

But either way, I want to get the Description / Content / Snippet / Revision (see what I mean? hard to tell what you're supposed to call things in which context...) when I'm generating a list of Random articles... they don't provide that content with the basic Random List generator endpoint, so I'm having to mix and match, and it's just not working.

It's really frustrating. I've found some good help on StackOverflow, but that feels like cheating. Haha I want to figure this one out all by myself!

Guess I'm addicted to coding now. Lol. I also finished the Random Quote Machine challenge from freeCodeCamp.

JSON APIs are hard sometimes! I thought I knew what I was doing when I built out the Random Quote Machine, but it took a lot longer than I thought it would to get it right. Ah well, you know what they say: practice makes better!

**Today's Progress:** I finished five of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Some of the solutions varied widely from my implementations. I learned about the .repeat() function on the JavaScript String prototype. Interestingly, each of the solutions was harder to get right than I thought it'd be. I think I need to start planning more thoroughly before I begin, that'd probably save me a decent amount of time.

**Today's Progress:** I finished five of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** These took a little longer than I thought they would! I struggled a lot on the Title Case challenge. Eventually I was able to complete it in a really awkward and seemingly inelegant way, and then when I checked the solution, I was right: there was a much more elegant solution... in fact, all of the solutions were far more elegant. I learned about the charAt() function in JavaScript.

## DAY ZERO: Thursday, December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deleted unnecessary files in one of my repos.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding to nuke this project where it was at, and start from scratch in other languages (was PHP/MySQL stack, now going to be creating it in Node, React, Express, and MongoDB), getting GitHub up and running, organizing files into a folder structure that would work, and overall just not being a newb. It's hard not to feel like a newb. lol
