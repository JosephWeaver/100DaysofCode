## R1D40: February 6, 2018
**Progress:** Continued on the freecodeCamp Tic-Tac-Toe game project, separated out some repositories.

- 09 üöß [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/rJOJpz)

**Thoughts:** I made a few improvements, but most of the commits from today are from moving a few of my freeCodeCamp projects to their own separate repositories.

**Progress:** Continued on the freecodeCamp Tic-Tac-Toe game project.

- 09 üöß [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/rJOJpz)

**Thoughts:** I got rid of the jQuery entirely, and I'm refactoring my functions for just JavaScript.

Also, I started adopting an object-oriented style, because I really feel like everything I write is spaghetti and that NEEDS to improve. I NEED practice doing this.

- 09 üöß [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/rJOJpz)

**Thoughts:** Had to stop using both HAML and SCSS, weirdly, because they were causing problems on CodePen... they kept switching back and forth being compiled, with every Save or AutoSave! Maybe talk to `@ChrisCoyier` about this... maybe just chalk it up to chance and try again later with the SCSS.

## R1D29: January 26, 2018
**Progress:** Continued on the Advanced Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp, and finished the Inventory Update, No Repeats Please, Make a Person, and Map the Debris challenges. Update: Finished the Pairwise challenge as well! That's all of them done! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

- 45 ‚úÖ [Map the Debris](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/map-the-debris)
- 46 ‚úÖ [Pairwise](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/pairwise)

**Thoughts:** Inventory Update wasn't too bad! I had some problems with CodePen crashing due to infinite loops when I was trying to test it out, that wasn't fun. I had to restart CodePen like five times.

No Repeats Please, on the other hand, was an absolute beast to get my mind around, but once I figured it out and searched a lot for examples of how other people had done it, it came through. I also had to learn how to use the `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` comment so that freeCodeCamp's code parser would accept my ES6 function generator syntax.

Make a Person was a cakewalk. Map the Debris was similarly relatively straightforward. Pairwise was a little hard to wrap my brain around at first, but after getting the problem in my head, it wasn't too bad. For a while I was adding the values together instead of the indices though, that wasn't good :P I was pretty confused.

## R1D25: January 22, 2018
**Progress:** Continued on the Advanced Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Exact Change was a huge pain! Figuring out exactly where to use the rounding function was a problem for me. In the end I just took off the round function from everywhere I had it, and used a bunch of `console.log()` commands to find out exactly where the math was being rounded a fraction of a penny. The other major problem I had was to return "Insufficient Funds" when I had more than enough money to make change, but not of the proper denomination, i.e. I had one single dollar, and one penny, but the change required was 50 cents. Eventually I figured that one out too. This was a really good challenge. It was challenging to wrap your head around a real life problem and solve it. It was like a more fleshed out version of the Roman Numerals algorithm problem because you actually had to deal with data type coercion, deal with limitations in programming languages (i.e. that $0.01 or 1 cent, will round to $0.0999999999987 or slightly less than a cent, meaning I would have to use rounding functions just to get basic integrity in the algorithm), and figure out use cases in which I had more than enough money, but not the correct kind to give proper change. I'm feeling happy and satisfied after having completed this one. üòä

## R1D22: January 19, 2018
**Progress:** Finished the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp! üéâ

**Thoughts:** Drop it was pretty easy. Steamroller was annoying. Skipped Steamroller for a while because I didn't wanna waste time on it until I was done with the rest. Frustratinggg. First time I skipped ahead. Then I went back and did it of course, but it took a lot of searching around online and I had to learn about new array functions which I hadn't been taught yet.

## R1D21: January 18, 2018
**Progress:** Continued on the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I spent a looooong time on the primes one, lol. I busted out a CodePen and basically brute forced everything, but ended up writing my own (maybe efficient?) algorithm, by re-re-re-re-factoring what I had. I ended up with a few different versions of an `isPrime(x)` function, and basically just tried to make it as un-verbose as possible without shooting myself in the foot. Eventually it worked, but I stayed up about 3 hours longer than I really should have. Eek. Tomorrow will be a struggle.

All told, I completed the next seven Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges. I'll continue on these tomorrow, most likely.

## R1D20: January 17, 2018
**Progress:** Mostly fixed the Firefox problems on [my website](http://www.joeweaver.me). Working on a [mockup for FreeCodeCamp's navigation](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/wpYmbL).

**Thoughts:** I find myself mimicking Codepen's functionality in my FreeCodeCamp mockup... interesting. It's a nice challenge to see if I can do it! If I can do even the basics of the panel-based editors, that'd be amazing (for me)!

## R1D19: January 16, 2018

**Thoughts:** I still need to fine-tune this for browsers other than Chrome. One of my friends said it looks a little awkward in Mozilla Firefox.

## R1D18: January 15, 2018
**Progress:** Re-did my website, with just my logo, proper color scheme, and some social icons.

**Thoughts:** I like the simplistic way it works. Also, it's more appealing than what I had online before (and was a lot easier to make!)

**Link to work:** [JoeWeaver.me](http://www.joeweaver.me)

## R1D17: January 14, 2018
**Progress:** Started up on the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Most of these were pretty straightforward. The "Wherefore Art Thou" challenge had a really confusing premise, but once I was able to figure it out, it wasn't too hard to get it completed. The most fun was the Roman Numeral Converter or the Pig Latin! üòÉ

All told, I completed the first seven Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges. I'll continue on these tomorrow, most likely.

**Progress:** Finished up the [Use the Twitch JSON API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api) project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Finished after midnight, but I spent at least an hour in each day so it counts! ;) And of course I'll be spending time coding later today as well.

**Progress:** Finished the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) project from freeCodeCamp!! üéâ

**Thoughts:** Totally done with the Wikipedia viewer! Nailed it lol. Wee hours of the morning, so I'm signing off and going to bed. Tomorrow may be pretty full so we'll see what happens... committing after midnight has its perks, haha! üòÖ Also, I changed all the `###`s to `##`s, change all the `Day 12`s into `R1D12`s, and I reversed the order of this log so that you can read it from the bottom up. üëç Ayyy.

Also, I started on the [Use the Twitch JSON API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api) project from freeCodeCamp. I haven't gotten far yet, we'll see if I have time to finish more later today!

## R1D11: January 8, 2018
**Progress:** Still working on the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Finally just finishing it up. I cleaned up sooo many things from when I had a ton of versions of files, with a bunch of `jscrap.js`, `jscrap2.js`, `...3`, `...4`, etc., with different versions of what I'd been working on, which weren't complete and/or had code which wasn't working, and I kept starting over. I swear, I must have tried like 10-15 different versions of my main AJAX query, and like 6-10 versions of my secondary one. I ended up putting everything into a couple functions, and they ended up chaining together ... I'm not sure it's the right way to do things, but it ended up working for me.

I also practiced using arrow function syntax, which ended up working out pretty well. There can now be an even shorter jQuery document ready function wrapper: `$(()=>{ `...` })`!~ And I feel like now's when my code will finally begin to look as unintelligible to normal people as some coding geniuses' code looks to me upon first glance! üòÇ w00t! ... for real though, I have such big ambitions... a year from now, I want to not only be a rockstar/ninja, I want to teach others to be rockstars and ninjas! üòä #Pray4MeFam üôèüôå

## R1D9: January 6, 2018
**Progress:** Still working on the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) project from freeCodeCamp. It's turning out to be quite a turd.

**Thoughts:** I'm at my wits end with this Wikipedia API haha. I still haven't found the correct combos of parameters/properties to pass to the API to give me back the data that I need... but soon! Very soon! lol üòÖ Whenever I get sick of failing with JavaScript I keep tweaking and fiddling with the SCSS, which is great in the short term, but it can eat up a lot of time as I have been playing with literally hundreds of different options for how things could look. The end result is... it looks pretty cool, but I already know how to make things look good; I should be focusing more on making them work. Yikes.

Also, I experimented with an Autocomplete option, but since I've already spent hours tweaking the way the responsive input works, it was too hard to get the results dropdown to follow the same style, and though it was certainly possible, it would have required a lot more time than I was willing to spend on it: remember, I'd already spent hours tweaking the responsivity worked, and I'd already wasted all that time on the SCSS instead of making the JavaScript work.

I also reimagined a lot of the JavaScript because that bastard just wasn't working for some reason. I stopped using `$.getJSON` in favor of `$.ajax` since that offers me the ability to specify that I want JSONP.

**Progress:** Still working on the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Geez louise this is a lot harder than I thought it'd be! I did some nice CSS/SCSS work to make it responsive and pretty at all screen sizes (well, down to max-width: 160px at least, which is far more than it'll ever need) but the JavaScript is killing me! I'm not sure if I just suck, or if Wikipedia's API is just that hard to use... which it might be... I'm having a lot of trouble with knowing which parameters to call, and when; for instance, how important is it that I have an empty callback?

And it looks like some of the parameters I want need to be run on other types of queries, and so I'm having to try to mix queries. I still haven't had success running an API request inside of a loop which is inside of another API request ... maybe that's impossible, who knows?

But either way, I want to get the Description / Content / Snippet / Revision (see what I mean? hard to tell what you're supposed to call things in which context...) when I'm generating a list of Random articles... they don't provide that content with the basic Random List generator endpoint, so I'm having to mix and match, and it's just not working.

It's really frustrating. I've found some good help on StackOverflow, but that feels like cheating. Haha I want to figure this one out all by myself!

## R1D6: January 3, 2018
**Progress:** Pretty much finished with the [Show the Local Weather](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather) project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I have been spending a lot of time styling things. I have been realizing that my [CodePen profile](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver) is really underwhelming. How do I expect to woo future employers with lame little snippets here and there which don't really showcase that I can put together a nice, full project, and polish it to completion? Soooo, that's what I'm doing with these projects. Huzzah!

## R1D5: January 2, 2018
**Progress:** Started on the [Show the Local Weather](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather) app for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Good to get more practice on the JSON stuff!

## R1D4.5: January 1, 2018
**Progress:** Guess I'm addicted to coding now. Lol. I also finished the Random Quote Machine challenge from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** JSON APIs are hard sometimes! I thought I knew what I was doing when I built out the Random Quote Machine, but it took a lot longer than I thought it would to get it right. Ah well, you know what they say: practice makes better!

The front-end development projects I have completed on CodePen for freeCodeCamp thus far:
- 01 ‚úÖ [Tribute Page for Richard Petty](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/VreEvV)
- 02 ‚úÖ [Personal Portfolio Project](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/aEJzog)
- 03 ‚úÖ [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/JoeWeaver/full/dJRPbE)

## R1D4: January 1, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Happy New Year! Today I finished the last three of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org):

- 14 ‚úÖ Seek and Destroy
- 15 ‚úÖ Where Do I Belong
- 16 ‚úÖ Caesar's Cipher

**Thoughts:** Array.prototype.slice.call(args) is one heck of a mind-bender the first time you come into contact with it. Here is [a good article from ShiftEleven](https://shifteleven.com/articles/2007/06/28/array-like-objects-in-javascript) which explains it pretty well.

## R1D3: December 31, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I started two new repositories for some of my side projects, Ultimate Web Ninja, a course I plan to teach online, and JosephWeaver.github.io, which is just me experimenting around with GitHub Pages. [Look how basic it is. Lol.](http://JosephWeaver.github.io)

I also finished more Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

- 11 ‚úÖ Slasher Flick
- 12 ‚úÖ Mutations
- 13 ‚úÖ Falsy Bouncer

**Thoughts:** I also learned about how to [update my Atom credentials](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-windows) so that I don't have to re-enter my username and password each time I pull or push my files. w00t! üòç In fact, I just pushed this file to master in one click!

## R1D2: December 30, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I finished five of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Some of the solutions varied widely from my implementations. I learned about the .repeat() function on the JavaScript String prototype. Interestingly, each of the solutions was harder to get right than I thought it'd be. I think I need to start planning more thoroughly before I begin, that'd probably save me a decent amount of time.

- 06 ‚úÖ Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
- 07 ‚úÖ Confirm the Ending
- 08 ‚úÖ Repeat a String
- 09 ‚úÖ Truncate a String
- 10 ‚úÖ Chunky Monkey

**Link to work:** [JosephWeaver/freeCodeCamp - merged Basic-Algorithms](https://github.com/JosephWeaver/freeCodeCamp/commit/c635e13fd7284035e3ffd8b4d75f6b4621a288a1)

## R1D1: December 29, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I finished five of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** These took a little longer than I thought they would! I struggled a lot on the Title Case challenge. Eventually I was able to complete it in a really awkward and seemingly inelegant way, and then when I checked the solution, I was right: there was a much more elegant solution... in fact, all of the solutions were far more elegant. I learned about the charAt() function in JavaScript.

- 01 ‚úÖ Reverse a String
- 02 ‚úÖ Factorialize a Number
- 03 ‚úÖ Check for Palindromes
- 04 ‚úÖ Find the Longest Word in a String
- 05 ‚úÖ Title Case a Sentence

## DAY ZERO: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deleted unnecessary files in one of my repos.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding to nuke this project where it was at, and start from scratch in other languages (was PHP/MySQL stack, now going to be creating it in Node, React, Express, and MongoDB), getting GitHub up and running, organizing files into a folder structure that would work, and overall just not being a newb. It's hard not to feel like a newb. lol
